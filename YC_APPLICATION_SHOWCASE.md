## Why This Document Exists

Garry Tan [said it](https://x.com/garrytan/status/2019565766232928477):

> *"The best products in the world will be built by those who fully use the tools like Claude Code and Codex to their absolute max. You can ship 100k LOC production quality code today with the right prompting that can scale up to full webscale overnight. We want to work with you."*

Y Combinator [asked for it](https://x.com/ycombinator/status/2019527704064741823):

> *"We want to see how you build with AI... you can upload a markdown file or transcript from Claude Code (or your favorite coding tool). We want to see how you plan, design, debug, and ship your most important features."*

**This is that document.** Not from one coding tool — from seven. Not a toy app — a production platform with 311,349 lines of code, 67 Supabase Edge Functions, 233 database migrations, 479 React components, and 606 merged pull requests. All built by a non-technical founder who taught himself to orchestrate AI agents like a conductor leads an orchestra.

## 2. The AI Agent Orchestra

I don't use one AI tool. I run an orchestra of seven, each chosen for its distinct strengths. This isn't random experimentation — it's deliberate agent selection based on task type, context window needs, and output quality.

### Agent Roster & Roles

| Agent | Primary Role | Why This Agent | Example Tasks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lovable** | Rapid UI prototyping, full-page scaffolding | Fastest at generating complete React pages with Supabase integration; visual-first workflow | Initial trip views, landing pages, component scaffolding, SMS infrastructure, role management UI |
| **Cursor** (Cloud Agent) | Feature implementation, bug fixes, testing, refactoring | Best IDE integration; can read entire codebase context; multi-file edits | Web push notifications, PWA config, test infrastructure, security fixes, event features |
| **Claude Code** | Architecture decisions, security audits, complex debugging, iOS readiness | Deepest reasoning; best at understanding system-wide implications | iOS Capacitor audit, auth flow fixes, notification gating, trip loading race conditions, RLS review |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Targeted fixes, type updates, RLS policies, data model changes | Fast at small, precise changes; good at following existing patterns | Role type updates, chat fixes, receipt management, broadcase composer updates, RLS policies |
| **Google Jules** | Multi-file refactors, permission models, landing page redesign | Strong at coordinated changes across many files; good at following instructions precisely | Trip permissions enforcement, marketing redesign, profile/auth fixes, Places tab logic |
| **Gemini 3 Pro** (via Cursor) | Navigation fixes, Maps integration, layout debugging | Excellent spatial reasoning for UI layout issues; strong at Google Maps API patterns | Maps integration, navigation bar fixes, layout centering, trip creation flows |
| **Antigravity** | Prompt optimization, architectural planning, strategy | Used for meta-prompting: refining prompts before sending to coding agents | Prompt engineering, system prompt design, CLAUDE.md engineering manifesto |

### The Key Insight

Each agent has failure modes. Lovable hallucinates component structures. Cursor sometimes over-refactors. Claude Code can be overly cautious. Codex makes minimal changes that miss edge cases. Jules occasionally breaks type imports.

**The skill isn't using AI. The skill is knowing WHICH AI to use WHEN, and catching what each one misses by cross-referencing with another.**

---

## 3. How I Orchestrate: The Multi-Agent Workflow

### Phase 1: Design & Plan (Human + Antigravity/ChatGPT/Claude)

Before any code is written, I design the feature in plain English. I use conversational AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity) to:

1. **Refine the product spec** — "Here's what I want the trip invite flow to do. Poke holes in this."
2. **Generate the system prompt** — I meta-prompt to create the exact instructions each coding agent will receive
3. **Identify affected files** — "Given this Supabase schema and these React components, which files need to change?"

**Example:** Before building the notification gating system, I spent 45 minutes with Claude discussing the architecture — should notification preferences live in Supabase or local storage? Should gating happen at the Edge Function level or client-side? We landed on Edge Function gating with client-side optimistic UI. Only then did I send the implementation task to Claude Code.

### Phase 2: Scaffold & Build (Lovable → Cursor)

```
Lovable: "Build me a notification settings page with toggles for email,
push, and SMS. Use Supabase to persist preferences. Follow the existing
Chravel design system with dark cards and orange accents."

→ Lovable generates the full page in ~30 seconds

Cursor: "The notification settings page Lovable built doesn't handle
the edge case where a user has never set preferences. Add a default
preferences migration and update the hook to handle first-time users."

→ Cursor reads the Lovable output, adds the missing logic
```

### Phase 3: Harden & Audit (Claude Code)

Claude Code reviews for:
- **Security**: Are there RLS policy gaps? Can a user see another user's notification preferences?
- **Race conditions**: What happens if the user toggles a setting while the previous save is still in flight?
- **Mobile safety**: Does this work on iOS Safari? Does the PWA handle this correctly?

```
Claude Code: "audit(ios): Complete iOS Capacitor readiness assessment and fixes"
→ Single commit that touches 14 files, fixes Capacitor plugin registration,
  updates haptic feedback patterns, and adds proper native bridge error handling
```

### Phase 4: Cross-Agent Review (Codex ↔ Cursor ↔ Claude Code)

**This is the most important part.** Every significant PR gets reviewed by a different agent than the one that wrote it.

---

## 4. The Meta-Prompting System

I don't just type "build me X." I engineer prompts using a layered system:

### Layer 1: The Engineering Manifesto (CLAUDE.md)

I maintain a 500+ line engineering manifesto (`CLAUDE.md`) that every AI agent reads before touching code. It includes:
- TypeScript patterns and anti-patterns
- Supabase integration rules
- Google Maps implementation patterns
- React component structure requirements
- Security gate requirements
- Pre-commit validation rules

**This file itself was meta-prompted** — I used Claude to help me design the optimal instruction set, then refined it through 15+ iterations based on which errors agents were making.

### Layer 2: Cross-LLM Prompt Refinement

Before sending a complex task to a coding agent, I refine the prompt through multiple LLMs:

```
Step 1: Draft the feature spec in natural language
Step 2: Ask Claude to identify ambiguities and edge cases
Step 3: Ask ChatGPT to restructure for maximum clarity
Step 4: Ask Gemini to validate the technical approach
Step 5: Send the refined prompt to the coding agent
```

This "prompt chain" means the coding agent receives instructions that have already been stress-tested by 3 different LLMs. The result: fewer hallucinations, fewer regressions, faster shipping.

### Layer 3: Agent-Specific Instruction Tuning

Each agent gets slightly different system prompts based on its strengths:

- **Lovable**: Gets visual descriptions and Figma-like specs. Told to use existing component library.
- **Cursor**: Gets file paths and exact function signatures. Told to read before writing.
- **Claude Code**: Gets architectural context and security requirements. Told to audit before implementing.
- **Codex**: Gets minimal, precise change descriptions. Told to make the smallest possible diff.

### Layer 4: The Ralph Method

Named after a debugging methodology I developed, the Ralph Method is documented in CLAUDE.md and involves:
1. Describing the exact symptom
2. Listing what was tried
3. Providing the relevant code context
4. Asking the AI to reason about root causes before proposing fixes

This reduced our "fix causes new bug" rate by an estimated 70%.

## 5. Multi-Agent PR Pipeline

### Every PR Gets Multiple AI Reviews

This is the workflow that makes our code quality rival teams of human engineers:

### Real Example: PR #597 — Event Card Organizer & Count

This PR received **8 review comments** across multiple agents:

1. **Cursor** implemented the feature (5 commits: organizer field, display name passing, mock hoisting fixes, e2e test updates)
2. **Claude Code** was asked to review for security — caught that `organizer_display_name` wasn't being validated at the Edge Function level
3. **Codex** was asked to review for type safety — suggested narrowing the type from `string | undefined` to `string`
4. **Meech** tested on mobile, verified the organizer name displayed correctly on event cards, merged

**Result:** Zero regressions. Feature shipped to production same day.

### The "Review Before Merge" Pattern Across 606 PRs

| Pattern | Count | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor implements → Claude reviews | ~120 PRs | Most common for feature work |
| Claude implements → Cursor reviews | ~80 PRs | Common for security/auth changes |
| Codex implements → Cursor/Claude reviews | ~50 PRs | For targeted type/data changes |
| Lovable scaffolds → Cursor/Claude hardens | ~200+ PRs | For new UI features |
| Jules implements → Claude audits | ~10 PRs | For multi-file refactors |

## 6. Feature Development: Plan, Design, Debug, Ship

### Case Study 1: Web Push Notifications (7 PRs, 3 Agents)

**The Problem:** Users needed real-time notifications for trip updates, chat messages, and itinerary changes. PWA push notifications are notoriously difficult, especially on iOS Safari.

**The Agent Orchestration:**

| Step | Agent | What They Did |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Architecture | Claude (conversational) | Designed the notification gating system: Edge Function → preference check → push delivery |
| 2. Core Implementation | Cursor | Built the full Web Push stack: VAPID keys, service worker, subscription management, Edge Function (`web-push-send`) |
| 3. iOS Workarounds | Cursor | Added iOS Safari-specific workarounds for push API limitations |
| 4. Security Hardening | Cursor | Implemented RFC 8291 encryption for payload security + auth/authorization on the Edge Function |
| 5. PWA Config Audit | Cursor | Workbox service worker caching, offline indicators, precached app shell |
| 6. Preference Gating | Claude Code | Full notification preference system: per-category toggles (trip updates, chat, calendar, broadcasts), persisted in Supabase |
| 7. Testing | Cursor | Admin panel for push notification testing and delivery analytics |

**Total: 12 commits, 7 PRs, 3 agents, shipped in 4 days.**

### Case Study 2: Role-Based Channel Access (12 PRs, 4 Agents)

**The Problem:** Pro/Event trips needed Slack-like channels where access is controlled by roles (Admin, Talent, Production, Logistics, etc.)

| Step | Agent | What They Did |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Data Model | Lovable | Scaffolded the role management UI, consolidated team roster |
| 2. Role Assignment | Lovable → Cursor | MVP role model migration, then Cursor fixed the "0 members" bug in role assignment |
| 3. Channel Access Logic | Cursor | Self-service `leave_trip_role` RPC, distinct user counting for channel members |
| 4. UI Polish | Lovable | Reflow role management UI, branding updates |
| 5. Security Fix | Claude Code | Fixed role filter counter, role pill lookup fallback, consolidated role management UI |
| 6. Auth Hardening | Claude Code | Role deletion warnings, role assignment button fixes, admin access collapsible section |
| 7. Badge Fix | Codex | Removed synced badge from public-facing pages (should only show in-app) |

**Total: 20+ commits, 12 PRs, 4 different agents, zero regressions.**

### Case Study 3: iOS App Store Readiness (8 PRs, 2 Agents)

**The Problem:** Take a web PWA and make it App Store-ready via Capacitor.

| Step | Agent | What They Did |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Capacitor Audit | Claude Code | Complete iOS readiness assessment: plugin registration, haptic feedback, native bridge error handling |
| 2. App Store Compliance | Claude Code | License file, audit of all markdown files, security tightening |
| 3. Mobile UX | Claude Code | Swipe-to-delete, mobile sign-out button positioning, search results mobile layout |
| 4. Native Behavior | Cursor | Route preservation on native reload, PWA trips tray close behavior |

### What the Graph Shows

The dip in Aug–Sep wasn't inactivity. It was **strategic planning** — I was:
1. Evaluating which AI tools to add to the orchestra
2. Designing the CLAUDE.md engineering manifesto
3. Setting up the multi-agent PR review pipeline
4. Rethinking the architecture from monolith to feature-based

When execution resumed in October, velocity **tripled** — because every agent now had clear instructions, consistent patterns, and a shared quality bar.

### Coding Around the Clock

The git log shows commits at every hour of the day:

```
Peak hours:  4 PM – 1 AM (when creative flow hits)
Off-peak:    8 AM – 10 AM (mornings for planning)
24/7 agents: AI agents can be dispatched at any hour
```

**I'm not just working hard. I'm running agents in parallel while I sleep.**

## 8. Why Chravel / Why Now / Why Me

### The Problem ($800B+ Market)

Group travel coordination is broken. The average group trip involves:
- 47 messages across 3 different group chats
- 12 browser tabs for research
- 4 different apps (Google Maps, Venmo, Calendar, Notes)
- 3 people who never respond
- 1 person doing all the work

For **professional travel** (touring artists, sports teams, corporate retreats, conferences), it's 10x worse: rosters, per diems, compliance documents, multi-city logistics, role-based access, real-time broadcasts.

**There is no single platform that handles both casual group trips AND professional touring/events.** That's Chravel.

### The Product

Chravel is the **AI-native operating system for group travel and events:**

- **Trip Chat** — iMessage-quality messaging with trip context (think WhatsApp, but every message knows which trip it belongs to)
- **Smart Itinerary** — AI-assisted calendar with conflict detection, multi-timezone support, drag-and-drop
- **Places & Maps** — Google Maps integration with Base Camp concept (home base + nearby search), distance calculations, route optimization
- **Shared Budget** — Expense tracking, splits, multi-currency, receipt OCR
- **Media Hub** — Shared photo/video albums with auto-organization
- **AI Concierge** — RAG-powered assistant with context over all trip data (chats, itinerary, places, budget, preferences)
- **Broadcasts** — One-to-many announcements with read receipts and priority levels
- **Polls & Tasks** — Collaborative decision-making and accountability
- **Pro/Events Mode** — Role-based channels, rosters, per diems, compliance, venue logistics, credential levels

### Why Now

1. **AI coding tools just crossed the threshold.** For the first time, a non-technical founder can build production software that rivals funded engineering teams. This window is open NOW — in 2 years, everyone will be doing this. First-mover advantage matters.

2. **Travel is the #1 consumer spending category post-COVID.** Group travel specifically is growing 2.4x faster than solo travel (Skift, 2025).

3. **Gen Z and Millennials plan trips in group chats.** They don't want heavy enterprise tools. They want something that feels like their favorite messaging app but with superpowers.

4. **No incumbent owns this.** TripIt is solo-focused. Wanderlog is itinerary-only. Splitwise is payments-only. Google Trips was shut down. WhatsApp/iMessage have no trip context. Slack is too enterprise for casual trips. **Nobody has built the unified OS.**

### Why Me

I'm not a traditional founder. I'm a **new category of founder** — the AI-native builder.

**What I lack:** A CS degree. Years of engineering experience. The ability to write a React component from scratch.

**What I have:**
- **Product obsession.** I've planned 50+ group trips. I know every pain point because I've lived them.
- **AI fluency.** I don't just use AI tools — I orchestrate 7 of them simultaneously, each assigned to its optimal task, with cross-agent review pipelines and meta-prompted instruction sets.
- **Relentless velocity.** 3,839 commits in 182 days. 606 merged PRs. 21 commits per day average. I ship faster than most 5-person engineering teams.
- **The thing Garry Tan is describing.** Read that tweet again. *"The best products in the world will be built by those who fully use the tools like Claude Code and Codex to their absolute max."* That's literally what this repo proves.

### The Unfair Advantage

Most founders using AI coding tools pick one and use it casually. I've built:

1. **A multi-agent orchestration system** that leverages the distinct strengths of 7 different AI tools
2. **A meta-prompting pipeline** that stress-tests prompts across multiple LLMs before implementation
3. **A cross-agent code review process** that catches bugs no single AI would find
4. **A 500-line engineering manifesto** that gives every AI agent consistent, production-quality output
5. **A proven track record** — 311K lines of code, 606 PRs, 67 Edge Functions, deployed and running at [chravel.app](https://www.chravel.app)

**This is not vibe coding. This is AI-native engineering at its highest level.**

## 9. What YC Gets

### The Investment Thesis

You're not just investing in a travel app. You're investing in:

1. **A founder who has already proven he can ship at 100x speed.** The codebase exists. The product is live. The methodology is battle-tested.

2. **A new paradigm for company building.** If one non-technical founder can ship 311K lines of production code with AI agents, what happens when you add a small team, YC resources, and a community of the best founders in the world?

3. **A platform play in an $800B+ market** with no dominant vertical solution for group coordination.

4. **The exact type of company Garry Tan described.** Built with Claude Code AND Codex AND Cursor AND Jules AND Gemini AND Lovable — used to their absolute max.

### What We'll Do With YC

| Timeline | Milestone |
|---|---|
| **Week 1–2** | Launch invite-only beta to 100 group trip organizers |
| **Week 3–6** | Iterate based on user feedback; add payment integration (Stripe) |
| **Week 7–10** | Launch Pro/Events tier for touring artists and event organizers |
| **Week 11–12** | Demo Day: Present traction, revenue, and expansion plan |

### The Ask

- **$500K safe** at standard YC terms
- Use of funds: User acquisition (influencer partnerships with travel creators), Supabase/infra scaling, and one senior engineer to pair with AI agents on the most complex systems (real-time sync, payment processing)

## Appendix A: Tool-by-Tool Technical Summary

### Lovable (2,357 commits | 313K lines inserted)
- **What it does best:** Generates complete React pages from natural language descriptions
- **How I use it:** First pass on all new features — gets 80% of the UI right in seconds
- **Weakness I compensate for:** Doesn't understand existing codebase patterns; needs Cursor/Claude to harmonize
- **Example commit:** "Add SMS infrastructure" — scaffolded the entire SMS notification system in one shot

### Cursor (464 commits | 223K lines inserted | 299 PRs)
- **What it does best:** Multi-file edits with full codebase context; excellent at bug fixes and refactoring
- **How I use it:** Second pass after Lovable; primary tool for feature hardening and test infrastructure
- **Weakness I compensate for:** Can over-refactor; sometimes changes things that don't need changing
- **Model switching:** I switch between Claude Sonnet, Claude Opus, and **Gemini 3 Pro Preview** depending on the task — 24 PRs used Gemini specifically for Maps/navigation/layout work
- **Example commit:** "feat: Implement Web Push Notifications for Chravel" — complex multi-file implementation

### Claude Code (333 commits | 118K lines inserted | 188 PRs)
- **What it does best:** Deep reasoning about architecture, security, and system-wide implications
- **How I use it:** Security audits, auth flow fixes, iOS readiness, complex debugging
- **Weakness I compensate for:** Can be verbose; sometimes proposes larger changes than needed
- **Example commit:** "audit(ios): Complete iOS Capacitor readiness assessment and fixes" — 14 files touched in a single coherent audit

### OpenAI Codex (86 PRs via `codex/*` branches)
- **What it does best:** Fast, precise, minimal-diff changes

## Appendix B: The Engineering Manifesto (Summary)

Every AI agent in our orchestra reads `CLAUDE.md` before writing code. Key sections:

- **Zero Syntax Errors** — Every bracket must close; mentally simulate `npm run build`
- **TypeScript Patterns** — Explicit types, no `any`, hooks rules enforced
- **Supabase Integration** — Never call Supabase in JSX; always handle errors; type results
- **Google Maps** — One map instance per page; null-check refs; debounce events; clean up listeners
- **Security Protocol** — No hardcoded secrets; validate all IDs; auth before data fetch; loading ≠ Not Found ≠ Empty
- **Pre-commit Gates** — `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build` must pass
- **The Final Rule** — *"If it doesn't build, it doesn't ship."*

## Appendix C: Git Statistics Methodology

All statistics in this document were generated using:

```bash
# Total lines of code
cloc . --exclude-dir=node_modules,.git,dist,build,.next

# Commits by author
git shortlog --all -sn

# Lines by author
git log --all --author="<author>" --shortstat

# PR counts by tool
gh pr list --state all --limit 700 --json headRefName

# Active days
git log --all --format="%aI" | awk -F'T' '{print $1}' | sort -u | wc -l
```

Every number is reproducible by running these commands on the `main` branch of the Chravel repository.

## Final Word

The future of building isn't human vs. AI. It's **human orchestrating AI.**

I'm not the best programmer in the world. I'm not even a programmer. But I might be one of the best **AI orchestrators** building today — and the 311,349 lines of production code, 606 merged PRs, and live product at [chravel.app](https://www.chravel.app) are the proof.

Y Combinator asked to see how we build with AI. This is how. Not with one tool. With seven. Not casually. At the absolute max.

**We want to work with you too.**

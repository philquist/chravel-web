## Step-by-Step Review Path

### 1. Authentication (2 minutes)
1. Launch the app
2. Tap "Sign In"
3. Enter the demo credentials above
4. You'll be taken to the home screen with sample trips

### 2. Trip Dashboard (2 minutes)
On the home screen you'll see:
- **3 sample trips** with different types (Consumer, Pro)
- Trip cards showing participants, dates, and status
- Filter tabs at the top (My Trips, Pro, Events, Recommendations)

**To test:** Tap on "Bali Destination Wedding" trip to open trip details.

### 3. Trip Chat (3 minutes)
Inside the trip, the **Chat tab** is the default view:
- Real-time messages between trip members
- @mentions highlighted in blue
- Message reactions (tap and hold any message)
- Send a test message using the input at the bottom

**To test:** Type "Hello!" and tap send.

### 4. Media Hub (2 minutes)
Tap the **Media tab** (camera icon):
- View shared photos and videos
- Tap the + button to add from camera or library
- Photos are organized by date

**To test:** Tap the + button, select "Photo Library", choose any photo.

### 5. Expense Splitting (3 minutes)
Tap the **Pay tab** (dollar icon):
- View existing expense splits
- See who owes whom
- Tap any payment to see details

**To test:** Tap "Add Expense" button, enter:
- Amount: $50
- Description: "Test Dinner"
- Split: Equal split (default)
- Tap "Create"

### 6. Calendar/Itinerary (2 minutes)
Tap the **Calendar tab** (calendar icon):
- View planned activities by day
- Tap any event for details
- Events show time, location, and notes

**To test:** Tap the + button to see the "Add Event" form.

### 7. AI Concierge (3 minutes)
Tap the **AI tab** (sparkle icon):
- This is our AI travel assistant
- It has context about the current trip

**To test:** Type "What restaurants are near our hotel?" and send. The AI will respond with contextual suggestions.

### 8. Push Notifications (1 minute)
If you granted notification permission:
- Have a team member send a message to see a notification
- Or, the demo account will receive a test notification within 30 seconds of being inactive

### 9. Deep Links (1 minute)
Test Universal Links by:
1. Copy this URL: `https://chravel.app/trip/demo-trip-1`
2. Open Safari and paste the URL
3. The app should open directly to the trip

### 10. Account Deletion (1 minute) — Guideline 5.1.1(v)
Chravel provides in-app account deletion:
1. Tap the profile icon (top right) → **Settings**
2. Scroll to the **Account** section → tap **Delete Account**
3. In the confirmation dialog, type **delete** (and re-enter your password if you signed up with email/password)
4. Confirm — this **immediately and permanently** removes the account and all
   associated data (profile, trips, messages, media, payment history, AI
   history). There is no waiting period or grace period; the user is signed
   out and the auth record is destroyed as part of the same request.
   Sign in with Apple grants are revoked as part of deletion.

**Note for reviewer:** A screen recording of this full deletion flow on a
physical device is attached / available on request.

## Special Notes

### Why we need Camera access
Users can take photos directly in the app to share with their trip group. The camera is accessed only when the user explicitly taps the camera button.

### Why we need Photo Library access
Users can select existing photos from their library to share with their trip group. Access is requested only when selecting media.

### Why we need Location access (when in use)
Location is used to show the user's position on trip maps and to provide nearby place recommendations. Location is never accessed in the background.

### Why we need Push Notifications
Notifications alert users to:
- New chat messages in their trips
- @mentions from trip members
- Payment requests
- Task assignments
- Upcoming calendar events

### Data Privacy
- We do not sell user data
- We do not use advertising identifiers (IDFA)
- **We do not track users** across apps or websites owned by other companies.
  No data is used for tracking as defined by Guideline 5.1.2 / ATT, so the app
  does not present an App Tracking Transparency prompt. Our App Privacy labels
  declare **"Data Used to Track You: None"** (see PRIVACY_MAPPING.md).
- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Users can delete their account and all associated data (in-app, see step 10 above)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **iPad:** The app is fully functional on iPad (iPhone-optimized layout scaled to iPad). All flows — including **Sign in with Apple** and **account deletion** — work on both iPhone and iPad.

2. **Apple Sign In:** Works on both iPhone and iPad. If using Sign in with Apple, the user can choose to hide their email; the app handles the private-relay address gracefully.

3. **Offline limitations:** While cached content is viewable offline, real-time features (chat, AI) require internet.

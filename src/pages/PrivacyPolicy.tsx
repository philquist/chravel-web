            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">AI-Powered Features</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
              ChravelApp uses artificial intelligence to power several features in the app,
              including the AI Concierge (text and voice), smart search, document and receipt
              parsing, trip planning suggestions, and agenda extraction. These features are powered
              by Google's Gemini AI models, accessed through Google's Generative Language API.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Data Sent to AI Services</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
              When you use AI-powered features, the following categories of data may be sent to
              Google's Gemini API for processing:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2 text-foreground/90">
              <li>
                <strong>User-provided content:</strong> Text prompts, search queries, and voice
                input you provide to the AI Concierge.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trip context:</strong> Information from your trip, including calendar
                events, task lists, group messages, polls, saved places, shared links, and payment
                summaries. This context helps the AI provide relevant, trip-specific responses.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Uploaded files:</strong> Documents, images, and receipts you submit for
                AI-powered parsing or attach to concierge conversations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Voice audio:</strong> When using the voice concierge feature, real-time
                audio from your microphone is streamed directly to Google's Gemini Live API for
                speech-to-text and response generation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>User preferences:</strong> If you are a paid subscriber, your saved
                preferences (such as dietary restrictions, travel style, and budget level) may be
                included to personalize AI recommendations.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
              We do not send your email address, password, user ID, device identifiers, IP address,
              or payment card information to AI services. We apply automated redaction to remove
              email addresses and phone numbers from text before it is sent to AI models.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Purpose of AI Processing</h3>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
              Data is sent to AI services solely to provide the requested functionality, including:
              generating conversational responses, answering questions about your trip, searching
              trip data, parsing documents and receipts, extracting event schedules from web pages,
              and providing personalized travel recommendations.

            <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
              We store your AI concierge queries and the AI-generated responses in our database to
              provide chat history, enable search across past conversations, and track usage for
              subscription metering. This data is associated with your user account and the relevant
              trip. Voice audio is processed in real time and is not stored on our servers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-foreground/90 mb-4">
              Stored AI interaction data is retained for as long as your account is active or until
              you delete it. We may use aggregated, de-identified AI usage data (such as query
              counts and response times) for service improvement and analytics. We do not perform
              human review of individual AI conversations except when required for abuse
              investigation, legal compliance, or at your request for customer support.

              <li>

              <li>
                <strong>Limit AI context:</strong> AI features use trip data you have already shared
                with your trip group. You can control what information the AI accesses by managing
                your trip content.

              parsing and smart search) is part of core functionality and cannot be individually
              disabled.
